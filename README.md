# ```JAVA QUEST```
 a 2D Adventure Game developed purely from the built-in Java class library! The player starts off on an island where they meet an old wizard! 
 From that wizard, the player gets clues to begin their big adventure! Combat, Markets, Puzzles, Boss Battles, Java Quest has it all!
 
 ### ```How to Run``` ###
 as long as you have Java installed on your device, the game can be opened by downloading and running the jar file! (adding jar soon...)
